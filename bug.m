In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

This seemingly innocuous code can lead to a retain cycle if `myString` is assigned a value that also holds a strong reference back to `MyClass`. For instance, if `myString` is a value that gets dynamically updated based on a process that uses `self` then a retain cycle exists. This leads to memory leaks and eventually crashes.
