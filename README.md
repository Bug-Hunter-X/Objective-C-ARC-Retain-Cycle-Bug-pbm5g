This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug involving retain cycles under Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). The `bug.m` file shows code that creates a retain cycle, leading to memory leaks. The solution (`bugSolution.m`) provides a corrected version illustrating proper memory management techniques to avoid this issue.  The bug is subtle and highlights the importance of careful consideration of strong and weak references in Objective-C.
